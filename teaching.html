<h2> Teaching & Outreach </h2>
<div class = "narrow_onecol">
<p>As much as I enjoy scientific research, I am also passionate about teaching both in and out of the classroom. My teaching philosophy is to prioritize building curiosity, developing skills, and fostering scientific thinking. I focus on big-picture concepts, transferrable skills, and thinking through examples, rather than on recalling any given piece of information, viewing much of the factual content as a means to these ends and as an opportunity to engage student interest. </p>

<p>I have taught human evolution as instructor of record, as well as multiple classes as a teaching assistant (<a href = "https://ggnanadesikan.github.io/Gnanadesikan_CV.pdf">see CV for details</a>). I am currently an NIH IRACDA postdoctoral fellow with the Emory FIRST program and will be teaching at Spelman College during the 2024-2025 academic year. </p>

<p>I also strive to bring science into K-12 classrooms and to the public, so as to increase accessibility to science and scientists. Countless polls have shown that the majority of Americans have never met a scientist and many can’t even name a living scientist. Furthermore, as early as elementary school, students overwhelmingly picture scientists as white males. It is important to me to do science outreach for a variety of reasons including 1) getting students excited about science and helping them realize that science is a career option, 2) developing familiarity with the scientific method, 3) broadening views on what scientists look like, and 4) building connections in local communities, including students, parents, and teachers.</p>

<p>I am excited to pursue a career as a scholar-educator and will be on the job market soon!</p>
