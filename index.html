  <td class="text_column">I am currently a FIRST postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://emory.edu">Emory University</a>, studying social cognition and oxytocin in capuchin monkeys. I recently earned my PhD from the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu">University of Arizona</a> in the <a href="https://anthropology.arizona.edu">School of Anthropology</a>, where I worked in the <a href="https://dogs.arizona.edu">Arizona Canine Cognition Center</a>. My dissertation was entitled <i>Genetic and Endocrine Contributions to Behavior and Cognition in a Working Dog Population</i> and was conducted in close collaboration with <a href="https://canine.org"> Canine Companions</a>. Before graduate school, I spent a year teaching English and music in an elementary school in rural China; I have also worked as a freelancer editor, substitute teacher, and choral singer.</td>

<td class="text_column">In the process of trying to measure neuropeptides in study samples during graduate school, I developed and validated improved methods of measuring oxytocin in a variety of species (canines, mice, humans, lemurs & titi monkeys) and biological matrices (blood plasma, urine, saliva), working extensively in the <a href="https://leepanthropology.weebly.com/">Laboratory for the Evolutionary Endocrinology of Primates (LEEP)</a>. I also served as a project coordinator for <a href="https://manydogsproject.github.io/md1/">ManyDogs</a>, where I took the lead on the experimental methods for our first collaborative project exploring the importance of ostensive cues for dogs using human gestural communication.</td>

<td class="text_column">In 2023, I moved to Georgia to start my postdoctoral work with Marcela Benítez in the <a href="http://www.marcelabenitez.com/socap-lab.html">Social Cognition & Primate Behavior Lab</a>, part of the <a href="https://apes.emory.edu/"> APE lab in the Emory Anthropology Department</a>. Here, I am building on my work measuring neuropeptides to study the role of oxytocin in supporting social behavior and cognition in capuchin monkeys. Capuchins are particularly social and cooperative and are one of many new world monkey species to carry a novel form of oxytocin. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://lrc.gsu.edu/">Language Research Center at Georgia State University</a>, which is home to the tufted capuchins (<i>Sapajus apella</i>) who are the focus of my postdoctoral research.</td>

      <h3>NEWS</h3>
<p>March 2024: Interactions between dogs and kids <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1ilXl,QxXoK7b">decrease cortisol in both species</a>! In children, this effect is largest for individuals with a (parent- and self-reported) stronger human-animal bond. This was part of a large, multi-year project that was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also allowed us to examine the effect of the pandemic on child loneliness and human-animal bonds, both of which increased although the two were not related to each other. It's exciting to see part one of this project finally out. (Stay tuned for part two: oxytocin!) </p>	  
	  
<p>January 2024: Neurophysin I (oxytocin's carrier protein) is an <a href = "https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1iOVg15hUdaweA">analytically robust surrogate biomarker for oxytocin</a>, as we report in a new short communication in <i>Psychoneuroendocrinology</i>, and it's easier to measure (with no extraction, and a very short ELISA) than oxytocin is (thank heavens). The work reported here is primarily in humans, although we make use of oxytocin knockout mice again as a ground-truth. We're already working on extending this to other species though, so stay tuned!</p>
	  
<p>December 2023: My first dissertation paper was published in <i>Behavior Genetics</i>! We explored associations between transponic insertions in the Williams-Beuren Syndrome critical region of dog chromosome 6 and social behavior, cognition, and training success in a working dog population, finding some strong associations with behavior and a moderate association between insertions in the gene <i>GTF2I</i> and training success in the <a href="https://canine.org"</a> Canine Companions</a> population. <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-023-10166-7"> Read more here</a>, or ask me for the pdf.</p>

<p>August 2023: I've started as a postdoctoral fellow in the SoCap Lab, under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.marcelabenitez.com/">Marcela Benítez</a>. I'll be working on social cognition and oxytocin in capuchin monkeys, and I can't wait to get started with the monkeys, once I finish all my trainings!</p>

<p>July 2023: I defended my dissertation, and my committee passed me with no revisions! Phew. It feels good to be done. The dissertation is still embargoed, while I work on getting the remaining papers ready for preprinting and publication, <a href="https://proquest.com/docview/2852398993">but you can view the abstract here</a>. </p>

<p>June 2023: The first of my <a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2902414/v1">dissertation papers has been preprinted</a>! In it, we explored the associations between transponic insertions in the Williams-Beuren Syndrome region of the dog genome and social behavior, cognition, and training success in a working dog population, <a href="https://canine.org">Canine Companions</a>.</p>

<p>June 2022: My second oxytocin methods paper is <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1fFDV15hUdX4eO">out at <i>Psychoneuroendocrinology</i>!</a> This one introduces a new extraction method that is especially important for minimizing interference in urinary samples.</p>

<p>April 2022: I was interviewed for this recent piece in <i>The Atlantic</i> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/dog-breed-personality-characteristics/629707/"> about dog breeds and genomics</a>.</p>

<p>March 2022: My second oxytocin methods paper has been preprinted! You can <a href="https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.03.482682v1">access the full preprint here</a>, or read the <a href="https://twitter.com/g_gnanadesikan/status/1499760298546241536">summary thread on Twitter</a>. It's focused on urinary oxytocin measures in a variety of species (using knockout mice again, as a ground-truth), epitope mapping of the Arbor Assays antibody, and cross-reactivity with biologically active fragments of oxytocin.</p>

<p>August 2021: My first oxytocin paper has been published! Check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/g_gnanadesikan/status/1422936705078685707">twitter thread about it</a>, or the <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1dWe815hUdTGgq">full text at <i>Psychoneuroendocrinology</i></a>.</p>

<p>July 2021: I had a nice discussion with Katie Wu at <i>The Atlantic</i> about cat and dog genomics, and why <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/cat-genomes/619587/">cats are understudied</a>.</p>

<p>July 2021: I chatted with <a href="https://www.upr.org/post/undisciplined-mans-best-friend">Utah Public Radio's Undisciplined</a> about our lab's recent study on puppy cognition, as well as domestication, cats, and my journey to comparative cognition.</p>

<p>June 2021: Our lab <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1dAw53QW8RwoJ7">published a new paper today</a>, and it's gotten some popsci coverage! Check out this lovely write-up in the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/puppies-are-born-ready-communicate-humans-180977881/"><i>Smithsonian Magazine</i></a>, this <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/03/health/puppy-social-skills-wellness-scn/index.html"> article from CNN</a>, and this <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/60-second-science/">podcast from Scientific American</a>.</p>

<p>May 2021: I commented on the recent cat cognition study that went viral for an article in <i>The Atlantic</i>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/cats-climbing-into-boxes/618858/">"Pay No Attention to that Cat Inside a Box"</a>.
